title: Second chance to Jekyll
---

I was searching for *the perfect*â„¢ blogging platform for last year and half.
Before I was fighting with WordPress which was exhausting and boring.
I found Jekyll about a year ago, but I was not able to make it work.

Today I'm giving Jekyll a second chance.

Let's try to resurrect this blog again.
