### A new blog

I used to have a blog on Google's **Blogger**, but it wasn't the right thing for me. Writing in a WYSIWYG can be nice for a normal person, but it's a nightmare for a techie. Just imagine including some source code examples, that's not really possible in a WYSIWYG.

So I downloaded **WordPress**, installed it onto my virtual server and with help of "Texy!":http://texy.info plugin I hope it'll be much easier for me to publish some interesting posts here.

**Disclaimer**: please be aware that I'm still trying to configure whole WordPress and that it's not so easy for someone who never used it. I'd be happy if you let me know if you see something is wrong here. Thanks
